# Tools 
## GitHub 
1. Sign up to GitHub
 - you will need an email address (does not have to be your student email address)
 - your username needs to be your student number
2. Find my CS220 repository (https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/CS220) and watch it (all activity)
3. Create a private repository (repo)
  - will be used for your private notes
  - when creating it add the `readme.md` file
4. Create a public repo <!-- or clone the template? -->
  - will be used for your public logbook (log) and public static website (GitHub Pages) 
  - when creating it add the `readme.md` file
  - this is a repo that you will have to submit

### Markdown
Familiarise yourself with Markdown language here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ (there is a shortcut for this link in the file editor in your repository). <!-- add a screenshot? -->

### thoughts
- there are slightly different Markdown versions, but in general they all work the same (stick to the above if using with GitHub)
- we can monitor each others' progress on the public repository. Please update it at least once a week. <!-- TODO: make example repo for private and public. Perhaps show examples of sonic art students from ARU. -->
- is GitHub safe to use e.g regarding tracking and cookies? [https://youtu.be/vAfBW1_AZkU?t=597](https://youtu.be/vAfBW1_AZkU?t=597)
- we can give feedback on each work in GitHub in different ways e.g. by raising an 'Issue' or collaborating and suggesting changes <!-- #todo make screencast -->
- GitHub vs Dropbox, etc. advantages/disadvantages 

<!-- #todo
- how to embed/create graphs in the markdown files in the repository e.g. in the `readme.md` file?
-->

## Visual Studio Code (VSC)
1. Install/launch the Visual Studio Code software on your computer
2. Make sure all of the following extensions are installed (some might need you to restart VSC or sometimes enabling when using a new folder/workstation e.g. when a GitHub repo is synced) :
  - Foam for VSCode (Wikilinks to Markdown)
  - GitHub Repositories
  - Markdown All in One (does not work with GitHub Repositories extension i.e. does not support virtual workstation)
  - Markdown Links
  - Markdown Notes
  - Markdown PDF
  - Spell Right
3. Sync your GitHub account to VSC
4. Make some changes to your `readme.md` file in VSC and commit to GitHub
 - check your changes in your GitHub account (with an internet browser)
<!-- TODO: do we need another markdown extension instead of Markdown All in One when working in virtual workstation? probably not if the main function we use this for is shortcuts e.g. bold, italics-->
  
### Thoughts
You can edit your files in both, you GitHub account via a browser or in VSC on your computer. The main advantages of using VSC are that
 - you can use VSC's extensions e.g. Spell Right (although in your own browser you could install browser extensions/plugins for this as well) or Foam that helps you organise your thoughts in a more creative, systematic way and 
 - VSC's editor itself provides further clarity e.g. with colour syntax an other tools e.g. search and replace for repetitive amendments
 - Markdown All in One's Table of Content function
 - option to export in PDF (customisable style in CSS)
 - once you have more notes you can use Jekyll (a static website generator) to create a novel website from your thoughts, writings and assets (e.g. images)

## GitHub Desktop
1. Lunch GitHub Desktop
2. Sign in to GitHub with the app
3. Clone a repository to the M drive
4. Open the cloned folder in VSC
5. Edit a file and save in VSC
6. Commit to master and push online
7. Check online for changes

## Foam 
https://foambubble.github.io/foam/
known issue: it does not work well when using the GitHub Repositories extension, because the one the essential extensions used for Foam, Markdown All in One does not work with virtual workspaces. So, the current idea is to use Foam with GitHub Desktop. To monitor issue: https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown/issues/996

### Thoughts
