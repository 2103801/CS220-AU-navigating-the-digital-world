### discuss 
<!-- #todo add more questions -->
- does multitasking work for you?
- can you define your relationship with technology, especially the web i.e. are you confortable using it?

## visitors and residents (v&r)
The visitors and residents modes of engagement with the technology was developed by White et al.

> V&R is a simple way of describing the range of ways individuals can engage with the Web. (source: http://daveowhite.com/vandr/) 

### part 1 - introduction to the v&r map
https://youtu.be/sPOG3iThmRI

- the v&r map can quantify our engagement with technology more accurately than [Marc Prensky](https://www.marcprensky.com/)'s Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants method
- the v&r method uses a 2D coordinate system to quantify our engagment with technology/web

<!-- #todo add image of clean map -->

- the v&r map helps all ages (not just old people) and people with low technical skills to use the web efficiently
- it is based on people's motivation to engage with the web and has two modes, visitor and resident modes, and is further refined by whether we engage in an activity in a personal or an institutional (professional) manner
- visitor modes: activities where **we don't leave a social trace behind** e.g. searching/reading information on the Web, watching videos, shopping, paying our bills. (Remember that your search history could be stored depending on the search engine you use, this search history is just not available for everyone. And also think about what information websites crawl from you when you visit them.) 
- resident modes: activities where we are present with other people and **we leave a social trance behind** (stays online after we leave the internet) e.g. by creating content or commenting on other people's content on online platforms (websites, social media). These activities are linked to our (digital) identities, therefore we should be mindful when we use the web in this mode. (We should be mindful when we use our visitor modes as well of course.)
- examples or personal engagements are e.g. using social media or emails to communicate with friends and family about personal matters
- examples of institutional activities are e.g. disseminating or discussing ideas as a worker (and perhaps as a student in highter eduction)

### part 2 - creditibility
https://youtu.be/kO569eknM6U

- before the web, institutionally reviewed resources were made available on paper, which, as it was expensive, meant that only experts were allowed to publish
- in contrast, the Web more recently provides an inexpensive method to share information to a potentially large audience without the institutional gatekeepers

> In the only environment where curation is by algorithm and not by librarian, convenience and relevance often outstrip traditional notions of creditibility and authority. The Web brings into question what it means for a source of information to be legitimate, and it highlights the trust we place in the form and provencance of those sources.

- traditional information (e.g. books) and information on the Web (e.g. a blog post) use different methods to gain attention and creditibility: 
  - traditional (established): validated by established institutions e.g. universities, publishing houses and know experts (promoted by institutions)
  - Web (new/emerging): search engines, likes, followers, views, comments (promoted mainly by individuals)

- using the Web to source information is convenient however might not provide the most accurate information. 

- earlier, students published their first work after their PhDs. Today the Web allows us to start developing our professional identity before finishing our doctoral research e.g. by expressing our oppinions about others' work openly and publishing our own work on our websites or relevant platforms e.g. vidoes on Vimeo, articles on Medium, music on SoundCloud, photos on Flickr, graphic design on Behance, software on GitHub etc.

### discuss
- should educators in higher education be active online e.g. share their teaching resources on the Web and engage with learners who did not formally enroll in a module?
- what is the future of education? <!-- what do students get for paying their high fees? -->
- shall students' learning rely entirely on the processes of formal education; lectures/workshops primarily using established forms of resources (e.g. academic journals) and assignments (e.g. essays or portfolios) or should their learning be more agile and incorporate the use of information on the Web (e.g. blog articles) and feedback on their works outside their workshops i.e. shall they seek feedback from people on discipline related forums?

- students should not be expected to know how to use institutional identities in resident mode efficiently? But **they should be encouraged** to develop this practice and **this is the reason why in the CS220 AU assignment you**
  - should experiment with privat and public GiHub repositories
  - can submit your reflection included in your public GitHub repository (which everyone can see online) or on FASER instead (you choose)
  - can choose between developing a website for your professional identity tied to your 'real name' or a website linked to one of your projects which does not have to be tied to your 'real name' but to a brand name instead e.g. 'Saving Trees In Colchester' or 'I help you understand the word', etc. 

### part 2 - open practice
https://youtu.be/1X0g2OvSdWc

- students are comfortable sharing information about their personal lives online, but less comfortable sharing information about their developing professional practices "especially if this might open them up to criticism or reveal mistakes and failings"
- the audience of traditional publishing is 
  - targeted i.e. if you publish in a journal on biology you will have primarily biologist reading your work
  - "usually is at a safe distance" i.e. if they criticise work they will do it in writing in a paper they publish (unless you present at a conference - some people can be harsh)
- the audience when publishing on the Web
  - (while being targeted) can be unlimited as well
  - can give you quick feedback linked to their real or not real identities
 - it might be better to consider work published online as unfinished, something that can start discussions
 - a powerful feature of open practice using the Web is the access to feedback from individuals or networks who are beyond the classroom
 - White believes 'that making the process of learning more visible and collaborative online challenges students to become relevant members of their discipline or academic community' (although does not suggest this for all subjects)
 - students should have their own private groups where they can express themselves withouth being afraid of being monitored
 - our main resident identities on the Web should probably not be a mix of personal and professional/institutional (hint: be personal in private groups and professional openly)

### discuss
- can someones professional identity be based on her private life?
- shall students start sharing information about their practice/reserch while studying or after finishing their degrees?
- could some of you set up a forum where you can openly discuss ideas/issues openly which are not monitored (by me or the university)?
- how can you continue the sentence "As education moves towards incorporating the use of the Web, ... "

### CS220 AU assignment reminder
1. reflection on your digital identity using two v&r maps (present and future)
2. a website linked to your professional identity (this can linked to your real name or one of your project's which does not have to be linked to your real name)

## discuss
- what do you know about data mining?
- do I know how Tech Giants e.g. Google and Facebook use my data?
