## Visitors and Residents (V&R)
### the V&R map

- V&R provides a new and more accurate method to quantify our engagement with technology than [Marc Prensky](https://www.marcprensky.com/)'s Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants method
- the V&R method uses a 2D coordinate system to quantify our engagment with technology/Web

<!-- #todo add image of clean map -->

"V&R is a simple way of describing the range of ways individuals can engage with the Web." (http://daveowhite.com/vandr/) White's V&R map helps all ages (not just old people) and people with low technical skills to use the Web efficiently. This map is based on people's motivation to engage with the Web and has two modes, visitor and resident modes, and is further refined by whether we engage in an activity in a personal or an institutional (professional) manner.

- visitor modes: activities where **we don't leave a social trace behind** e.g. searching/reading information on the web, watching videos, shopping, paying our bills. (Remember that your search history could be stored depending on the search engine you use, this search history is just not available for everyone. And also think about what information websites crawl from you when you visit them.) 
- resident modes: activities where we are present with other people and **we leave a social trance behind** (stays online after we leave the internet) e.g. by creating content or commenting on other people's content on online platforms (websites, social media). These activities are linked to our (digital) identities, therefore we should be mindful when we use the Web in this mode. (We should be mindful when we use our visitor modes as well of course.)

- examples or personal engagements are e.g. using social media or emails to communicate with friends and family about personal matters
- examples of institutional activities are e.g. disseminating or discussing ideas as a worker (and perhaps as a student in highter eduction)

### creditibility
https://youtu.be/kO569eknM6U

- before the Web, institutionally reviewed resources were made available on paper, which, as it was expensive, meant that only experts were allowed to publish
- in contrast, the Web more recently provides an inexpensive method to share information to a potentially large audience without the institutional gatekeepers

"1:10 In the only environment where curation is by algorithm and not by librarian, convenience and relevance often outstrip traditional notions of creditibility and authority. The Web brings into question what it means for a source of information to be legitimate, and it highlights the trust we place in the form and provencance of those sources."

Traditional information (e.g. books) and information on the Web (e.g. a blog post) use different methods to gain attention and creditibility: 

- traditional (established): validated by established institutions e.g. universities, publishing houses and know experts (promoted by institutions)
- Web (new/emerging): search engines, likes, followers, views, comments (promoted mainly by individuals)

Using the Web to source information is convenient however might not provide the most accurate information. 

Earlier, students published their first work after their PhDs. Today the Web allows us to start developing our professional identity before finishing our doctoral research e.g. by expressing our oppinions about others' work openly and publishing our own work on our websites or relevant platforms e.g. vidoes on Vimeo, articles on Medium, music on SoundCloud, photos on Flickr, graphic design on Behance, software on GitHub etc.

Should educators in higher education be active online e.g. share their teaching resources on the Web and engage with learners who did not formally enroll in a module? What is the future of education? <!-- what do students get for paying their high fees? -->

Shall students' learning rely entirely on the processes of formal education; lectures/workshops primarily using established forms of resources (e.g. academic journals) and assignments (e.g. essays or portfolios) or should their learning be more agile and incorporate the use of information on the Web (e.g. blog articles) and feedback on their works outside their workshops i.e. shall they seek feedback from people on discipline related forums?  

Shall students be expected to know how to use they should use their institutional identities in resident mode? No, but **they they should be encouraged** to develop this practice. Note: this is why in this module you

- should experiment with privat and public GiHub repositories
- can submit your reflection included in your public GitHub repository (which everyone can see online) or on FASER instead
- can choose between developing a website for your professional identity tied to your 'real name' or a website linked to one of your projects which does not have to be tied to your 'real name' but to a brand name instead e.g. 'Saving Trees In Colchester'.

### thoughts
- White developed his v&r modes of engagement on Marc Prensky's ideas of digital natives and digital immigrants to develop his v&r modes of engagement. [search](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=digital+natives+and+digital+immigrants&t=hx&va=g&ia=web)

### CS220 AU assignment
1. reflection on your digital identity using two v&r maps (present and future)
2. a website linked to your professional identity (this can linked to your real name or one of your project's which does not have to be linked to your real name)

## questions
- data mining? 
- which of my data am I happy with Tech Giants using?
