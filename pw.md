# Password managment
Based on some suggestions e.g. [1](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=password+best+practices+2021&t=brave&ia=web), here are mine:
- use a mix of characters: 
 - capital letters e.g. 'C'
 - lower case letters e.g. 'l'
 - numbers e.g. '75'
 - symbols e.g. '<+>'
 - don't use words that can be found in dictionaries e.g. 'Lemon'
 - don't use simple passwords e.g. '12345', 'aaaaaa', '1234abcd'
 - don't use words that could be guessed from your social media profiles e.g. your dog's name
 - don't use the same password on different websites e.g. on Facebook and Twitter
 - don't use context-specific words e.g. 'instagram-ILOVEu'
 - make it at least eight characters long (but try to make it longer)
 - avoid storing your passwords in physical notebooks, software that is easy to access or online folders e.g. Dropbox
 - use a good password managemer with a very good password
 - make it longer instead of more complex [REF](https://securityboulevard.com/2021/03/nist-password-guidelines-2021-challenging-traditional-password-management/)

### thoughts
- complex and long passwords which don't use dictionary words are easy to forget
- long length is still the best practice
