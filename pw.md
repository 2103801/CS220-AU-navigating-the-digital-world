# Password managment
Based on some [suggestions](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=password+best+practices+2021&t=brave&ia=web), here are mine:

**don't** use 
- words that can be found in dictionaries e.g. 'Lemon' or 'love'
- simple passwords e.g. '12345', 'aaaaaa' or '1234abcd'
- words that could be guessed from your social media profiles e.g. your dog's name
- the same password on different websites e.g. on Facebook and Twitter
- context-specific words e.g. 'instagram-ILOVEyou' on Instagram
- physical notebooks to store your passwords, software or online folders

use
- at least eight characters (but ideally more)
- longer instead of more complex passwords [REF](https://securityboulevard.com/2021/03/nist-password-guidelines-2021-challenging-traditional-password-management/)
- a good password manager app with a good password
- a mix of characters: 
  - capital letters e.g. 'C'
  - lower case letters e.g. 'l'
  - numbers e.g. '75'
  - symbols e.g. '<+>'


### thoughts
- complex and long passwords which don't use dictionary words are easy to forget
- a long password is still the best practice
