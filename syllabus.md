## w2 module introduction and digital identities
- intro by Paula / AU clarification
- see DAVE and your PC

_Everyone logged in to Moodle? Did you find the link to this GitHub repository?_

- you are free to leave the room anytime you feel you need some fresh air/the toilet, etc. 
- we will try to have a 10 min break in the middle

_Have you received my email last week? Who wants to introduce him/herself?_

I can go first:

> Hello! My name is Krisztián Hofstädter, aka tEdör. I am a creative technologist working as a researcher, lecturer, freelancer, and artist. My primary interests are brain-computer music interfacing linked to meditation, electronic dance music and animal rights. I was born in Hungary and have been living in the U.K. since 2005. You can find most of my work on my personal website https://khofstadter.com/

### introduction and theory
- quick intro to syllabus
- [module introduction](README.md)
- 10 min break? (who has a class after this?)
- [digital identities](digital-identities.md)

### is this module for you?
In essence the module can help you 
- develop your engagement with the Web and your professional identity
- understand basic web design and make a free (fast) website
- with feedback from me and your class on your progress

### homework
- please send me your short introductions via email by next week's seminar
- start making your first V&R map on paper or in software (you can use the .svg file in the assets folder) - check the examples on White's [website](http://daveowhite.com/vandr/vr-mapping/)
- explore links in the [digital identities](digital-identities.md) file
- explore the [di-identities](https://krisztian-hofstadter-tedor.github.io/CS220-AU-portfolio/di-reflection.html) file in the CS220 portfolio template repository. It could give you ideas for your writing. (We will check this repository together next week.)
- consider joining the [CS220 Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/400596074925260) 
- consider creating an online group for yourself where you can discuss module related questions without me/university monitoring it

### discuss progress

This week I will introduce

- how you can use Visual Code Studio on the PC to streamline your project management with GitHub

### clarification
- the word count for your di-identity reflection shoudl be between 750-1000 words (not 500 as indicated in Paula's slides last week)
- there is no official reading list, but there are many links and references in the files on this repository that I would encourage you to check (especially the V&R map website)
