#### Visitors and Residents (Dave White)
"Visitors and Residents is a simple way of describing the range of ways individuals can engage with the Web." (http://daveowhite.com/vandr/) White's V&R map helps all ages (not just old people) and people with low technical skills to use the Web efficiently. His V&R map is based on people's motivation to engage with the Web and has two modes: visitor and resident modes
- visitor modes: the activities where we don't leave a social trace behind e.g. searching the web, paying our bills. (Remember that your search history could be stored depending on the search engine you use, this search history is just not available for everyone.) 
- resident modes: activities where we are present with other people and our we leave a social trance (stays online after we leave the internet) e.g. by creating content or commenting on other people's content on online platforms (websites, social media). These activities are linked to our (digital) identities, therefore we should be mindful when we use the Web in this mode.

- this CS220 (AU) course introduces ideas and practical skills to help develop our residence modes
- Why? Because a better understanding of our residence modes can lead to 
  - better professional identies, better understanding of how we shoul produce and consume knowledge e.g. regarding the credibility of information
