Hello! My name is Krisztián Hofstädter, aka tEdör. I am a creative technologist working as a researcher, lecturer, freelancer and artist. My main interests are brain-computer music interfacing linked to meditation, electronic dance music, the link between art and science and animal rights. Most of my work can be found on my personal website [https://khofstadter.com/](https://khofstadter.com/) - which I redesign frequently.
