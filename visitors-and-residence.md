## visitors and residence
This week, we'll be looking at the concept of Visitors and Residents as developed by Dave White. The V&R model is a simple idea that will help you better understand your current relationship with digital technology. We will also explore Marc Prensky's notion of digital natives and digital immigrants; an older idea that inspired the development of the visitor and resident modes of engagement.

You will be asked to complete a V&R map. This hands-on exercise—which can be completed with pen and paper or a digital tool like Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides, Apple Keynote or Miro—will force you to reflect on how you use digital technology in different contexts. This map will form the first part of your digital portfolio.

You will also be encouraged to explore your own "digital journey" by thinking about the different digital devices you have bought (or been given) over your lifetime.

## exploring your cyberselves
This week, you will learn about managing your online identity and digital footprints.
As part of your digital portfolio, you need to create an about.me and LinkedIn profile, or a well-crafted CV (if you would rather not use these two online services).
