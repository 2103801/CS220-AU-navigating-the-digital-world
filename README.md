- are breakout rooms in hybrid classes possible?

refine module specs: 
0. work on tools.md and minimise syllabus outline in README.md
1. make screencasts and edit them in a video editor + upload to YouTube
2. think about theory
  - watch Marty's videos, content.
  - Center for Humane Technology email (take out info)
  - Rebel Wisdom gist
  - Daniel Schmachtenberger Gist  
3. link practice to theory: 
   - how does the module assigment (website) help critical thinking?

# CS220 Navigating the Digital World
University of Essex    
Department: Interdisciplinary Studies   
School of Philosophy and Arts History  
Wed 11-1pm Lab M  
Thu 11-1pm Lab G  
![https://moodle.essex.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=7522](https://moodle.essex.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=7522) 

<!--
Option A: lectern PC running same windows as students use on their computers. 
- both lecterns (lab G and M) are faulty, they need repairing;
- both Zoom screens should be relocated to the other side of the room
- lectern demonstartes software as well as connects to Zoom
- the projection is not ideal as students in the back won't see what's projected (but perhaps the Zoom screen TV has a better screen)
Option B: macbook running Windows via Remote Desktop. 
- in lab M - try HDMI long cable
- in lab G - try thunderbolt adapter and ask for minijack extension
Option C in lab M: 
- use a student computer in the first row with an HDMI cable

## Module description (AU and SP)
What does it mean to be a "digital citizen"? As increasing portions of our personal and professional lives are played out online, acquiring the ability to effectively use digital interfaces and think critically about them is an ever more urgent task, as well as a topic of fierce debate. While some allege that we live in a "post-fact" era filled with "fake news" that limits our worldview, others see in digital technologies the key to unlocking social change and bringing people together in new ways and across geographical boundaries.

The digital revolution is constantly reshaping our world in a myriad of ways: from surveillance laws to social mobilisation; from innovative business models to open access information; from warfare strategy to medical treatment. Not only this, the way we construct our individual identities, build communities, protect human rights, and promote the humanities is increasingly mediated through online platforms, and contingent on the uneven access that global communities have to technology.

## AU module specifics
To actively take part in our fast-evolving world, we need to have control over our own digital identities. The Autumn module aims to help manage our digital identities by (1) introducing a the 'visitory & resident map' that can help inspect our involvement with the Web and then (2) introcudes tools for project management, web-design and development as well as audio-visual tools to help develop our personal and professional digital identities. While the Autumn module is primarily focused on providing practical skills it will also open up dialogues to help develop critical thinking about our digital interactions.

The module introduces primarily free and cross-platform software and highlights their advantages and disadvantages to paid software. 

## Students
Studens enrolled in this module come from different disciplines/departments e.g. journalism, psychology, philosophy, art history, political science, media studies, literature. Most who enroll are 1st year, but there are some 2nd and 3rd years as well. Some students only do the practical part of the module (taught by Krisztian), some only the theoritical part (taught be Paula), some do both. Due to Covid, the classes will use a hybrid/dual mode teaching method i.e. some students will be in the classroom with me and some will attend via the online Zoom meeting. Students cannot swap around and do learning some weeks face-to-face and other weeks remotely. (CS220AU - Authumn enrollment, CS220SP - Spring enrollment, CS220FY - enrollement in both terms). 

<!-- add sense making -->

Some of the key questions we'll be addressing

- how are we currently engaging with the Web and have this be more 'better'?
- how can we build and use our online identities e.g. a website for 'better' engagement?
- how can we use software tools to create assets e.g. audio-video content to help us disseminate information through our online identities?
- how can we apply critical thinking regarding the information we consume and produce? 
<!-- 
- how are digital technologies transforming society?
- to what extent do digital technologies curb or enhance our rights and freedom?
- what digital skills are needed for the knowledge economy and a democratic society?
-->

After this primarily practical Authum term module, lecturers from different disciplines across the University will lead a series of weekly lectures during the Spring term, which will combine theoretical questions with real-life scenarios to explore issues such as hacking, social media, ethics, digital crime, video games and interactive technologies. These sessions are devised to help students gain a broad awareness of, and to think critically about, the ways that digital technologies are reshaping contemporary societies.

## module aims/goals
- to introduce tools/methods for efficient project management including logging, writing, audio-visual production, web-desing and web-hosting
- help acquire technical skills required to create and maintain a personal website
- primarily practical with some theory to induce discussions on the effective use of digital technologies

## assignment criteria
<!--TODO: 
- provide a repository example that perhaps students could download/upload or clone?
- check current module assessment criteria and adjust to own module syllabus
- write checklist
- examples: last year's CS220 and sonic art
-->

## module outcomes
By the end of this module, students should have

- a deeper understanding of digital literacies, as well as the confidence and ability to use a broad range of digital technologies
- the ability to discuss the material covered on the module and to demonstrate this competence through coursework, seminar discussions and the creation of a website
- a good understanding of topics and debates that are central to the digital world 
- confidence in using a number of specialised terms and terminology on digital technologies
- a deeper understanding of the impacts of digital technologies on society and human life

## syllabus
This syllabus was desinged to provide you with a basis for your online identity (or one of your projects' online identity) which is a personal or a project website. (For the assignment you can work on a personal or a project website.)

##### Visitors and Residents (Dave White)
"Visitors and Residents is a simple way of describing the range of ways individuals can engage with the Web." (http://daveowhite.com/vandr/) White's V&R map helps all ages (not just old people) and people with low technical skills to use the Web efficiently. His V&R map is based on people's motivation to engage with the Web and has two modes: visitor and resident modes
- visitor modes: the activities where we don't leave a social trace behind e.g. searching the web, paying our bills. (Remember that your search history could be stored depending on the search engine you use, this search history is just not available for everyone.) 
- resident modes: activities where we are present with other people and our we leave a social trance (stays online after we leave the internet) e.g. by creating content or commenting on other people's content on online platforms (websites, social media). These activities are linked to our (digital) identities, therefore we should be mindful when we use the Web in this mode.

- this CS220 (AU) course introduces ideas and practical skills to help develop our residence modes
- Why? Because a better understanding of our residence modes can lead to 
  - better professional identies, better understanding of how we shoul produce and consume knowledge e.g. regarding the credibility of information

- check slides on http://daveowhite.com/vandr/vr-mapping/ for map examples

questions to ask ourselves
- can our current map be improved?
