TODO:
- email Luke (how can students access the labs, book microphones or cameras (what tools do they have access tool?)
  
refine module specs: 
0. work on tools.md and minimise syllabus outline in README.md
1. make screencasts
2. think about theory
  - watch Marty's videos, content.
  - Center for Humane Technology email (take out info)
  - Rebel Wisdom gist
  - Daniel Schmachtenberger Gist  
3. link practice to theory: 
   - how does the module assigment (website) help critical thinking?
   - finish good module outline on GitHub Repo
4. change Moodle / send an overview to Paula

# CS220 Navigating the Digital World
University of Essex    
Department: Interdisciplinary Studies   
School of Philosophy and Arts History  
Wed 11-1pm Lab M  
Thu 11-1pm Lab G  

## Students
Studens enrolled in this module come from different disciplines/departments e.g journalism, psychology, philosophy, art history, political science, media studies, literature. Most who enroll are 1st year, some 2nd and 3rd years as well. Some stuents only do the practical part of the module (taught by me), some only the theoritical part (taught be Paula). Due to Covid, the classes will use a hybrid/dual mode teaching method i.e. some students will be in the classroom with me and some will attend via the online Zoom meeting.  

## Module description
What does it mean to be a "digital citizen"? As increasing portions of our personal and professional lives are played out online, acquiring the ability to effectively use digital interfaces and think critically about them is an ever more urgent task, as well as a topic of fierce debate. While some allege that we live in a "post-fact" era filled with "fake news" that limits our worldview, others see in digital technologies the key to unlocking social change and bringing people together in new ways and across geographical boundaries.

The digital revolution is constantly reshaping our world in a myriad of ways: from surveillance laws to social mobilisation; from innovative business models to open access information; from warfare strategy to medical treatment. Not only this, the way we construct our individual identities, build communities, protect human rights, and promote the humanities is increasingly mediated through online platforms, and contingent on the uneven access that global communities have to technology.

In order to be active parts of our fast-evolving world, it is useful to have control over our own digital identity. The module will help you manage your digital identity by introducing software tools for project management, web-design and development as well as audio-visual production. While the module is primarily focused on providing practical skills it will also open up dialogues to help develop critical thinking about our digital interactions.

I will try to introduce primarily free and cross-platform software and highlight their advantages and disadvantages to paid software. 

<!-- add sense making -->

Some of the key questions we'll be addressing

- how can we build and use our online identities?
- how can we use digital technologies as creative and engaging forms of communication?
<!-- 
- how are digital technologies transforming society?
- to what extent do digital technologies curb or enhance our rights and freedom?
- what digital skills are needed for the knowledge economy and a democratic society?
-->

After this primarily practical Authum term module, lecturers from different disciplines across the University will lead a series of weekly lectures during the Spring term, which will combine theoretical questions with real-life scenarios to explore issues such as hacking, social media, ethics, digital crime, video games and interactive technologies. These sessions are devised to help students gain a broad awareness of, and to think critically about, the ways that digital technologies are reshaping contemporary societies.

## module aims/goals
- to introduce tools/methods for efficient project management including logging, writing, audio-visual production, web-desing and web-hosting
- help acquire technical skills required to create and maintain a personal website
- primarily practical with some theory to induce discussions on the effective use of digital technologies 

## module assignment
One GitHub repository containing at least three files:
  - README.md file:
    - short overview/abstract
    - link to project website
    - link to report.md
    - lookbook
  - report.md (500 - 750 word) 
  - report.pdf (report.md exported into PDF format)
    - report needs to contain: project goals, design, testing, development, deployment (include feedback from others)

## assignment criteria
<!--TODO: 
- provide a repository example that perhaps students could download/upload or clone?
- check current module assessment criteria and adjust to own module syllabus
-->

## module outcomes
By the end of this module, students should have

- a deeper understanding of digital literacies, as well as the confidence and ability to use a broad range of digital technologies
- the ability to discuss the material covered on the module and to demonstrate this competence through coursework, seminar discussions and the creation of a website
- a good understanding of topics and debates that are central to the digital world 
- confidence in using a number of specialised terms and terminology on digital technologies
- a deeper understanding of the impacts of digital technologies on society and human life

## syllabus
This syllabus was desinged to provide you with a basis for your online identity (or one of your projects' online identity) which is a personal or a project website. (For the assignment you can work on a personal or a project website.)

  - k.khofstadter.com
  - you <!-- TODO: create a database -->
    - which departments do you come from?
    - will you use the lab PCs or your own computer?
    - have you used other studios (Rebel/Media) before?
    - what software/hardware do you have experience with e.g. microphones, video cameras?

### w3 GitHub and Visual Code Studio
### GitHub Repositories
- in class create two GitHub repositories (repos) 1 public and 1 private.
- you don't need to use the private one (you could use any other journaling/note making tool)
- the public repo will be used to: 
  - archive your regularly updated log (minimal, public facing, succinct)
  - create a simple static website with GitHub Pages (you can submit another website e.g. Wordpress website)
  - store your report (in Markdown and PDF version for your submission)
