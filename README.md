This repository contains information for the CS220 AU, 'Navigating the Digital World' module, the Autumn term module. Information for Dr Di Franco's more theoretical module (CS220 SP) is on Moodle. If your enrolment code is CS220 AU (Autumn) or CS220 FY (Full Year) then the information below is relevant for you.

## module description
The university's module description is on Moodle (or see in [assets/doc](https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/CS220-AU-navigating-the-digital-world/tree/main/assets/doc) folder).

<br>

## further clarification
The module aims to **help manage our digital identities**

1. by introducing David White and his colleague's [Visitors & Residents (V&R) modes](digital-identities.md/#visitors-and-residents) to help understand and develop our activities on the Web and 
2. by introducing tools for project management, web-design and hosting as well as audio-visual production and post-production, all which can help develop our personal and professional/institutional resident identities on the Web i.e. resident modes of engaging on the Web.

<br>

While this module primarily focuses on providing practical skills, it also opens up dialogues to help develop critical thinking about our digital identities and interactions e.g. by asking the following questions:

- how are we currently engaging with the Web, and how can we improve this?
- how can we build and use our online identities e.g. a website for 'better' engagement?
- what does 'better' engagement mean and how can we relate it to problem-solving?
- how can we use software tools to create assets e.g. audio-video content, to help disseminate information via our online identities more effectively?
- how can we apply critical thinking regarding the information we consume and produce?
- why should we produce information and whom should we address with this information i.e. who is our target audience?
- what is the change we would like to see in the world and how can we use our resident identities on the Web to support this change?

The module introduces primarily free and cross-platform software and, where possible, highlights their advantages and disadvantages to paid software. As the module in 2021 runs in labs equipped with Windows PCs, I demonstrate software in the workshops and screencasts using Windows 10 operating system (OS). However, as the OS I primarily use is macOS, if desired, I can demonstrate on macOS as well.

<br>

### syllabus
You can find the outline of the weekly workshops in the [syllabus](syllabus.md) file. This outline is subject to change based on students' progress.)

<br>

**How much theory will we cover in this module?**

in week 2
- an overview of generations and the Visitors and Residents map

in later weeks
- information processing (sensemaking), critical thinking and dissemination
- intelligent search strategies using Google vs Duck Duck Go, Google Scholar and the library website
- e-safety e.g. efficient use of passwords

The rest of the module is practical:
1. we will experiment with software that can help us create and maintain 'better' digital identities and 
2. we will discuss and provide feedback on each others' progress

<br>

## assignment
The assignment is to submit a digital portfolio using GitHub (and FASER) containing
- a weekly updated logbook on your progress
- a link to your personal or professional website that you develop for this module (can be about you or about one of your projects)
- a brief report reflecting on your present and future digital identity (or identities) using the V&R map

We can find more detailed information in the [template portfolio](https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/CS220-AU-portfolio), which is explained in the workshops. 

Note: Everyone can have multiple identities on the Web (you might already have a few anonymous avatars) however (probably) only one professional identity. Our personal identities are more informal, subjective and our professional ones more formal and perhaps more objective as well. For the assignment, you can choose to develop (or further develop) a digital identity linked to your real name or a digital identity linked to a project which is not linked to your real name. 

<!-- ### assignment examples #todo: 
A few submissions from last year (Essex and ARU) to plant some ideas.

## students
Students enrolled in this module come from different disciplines/departments e.g. journalism, psychology, philosophy, art history, political science, media studies, literature. Most who enrol are 1st year, but there are some 2nd and 3rd years as well. Some students only do the practical part of the module (taught by me), some only the theoretical part (taught by Dr Di Franco), some do both. Because of Covid, the workshops will use a hybrid/dual-mode teaching method i.e. some students will be in the classroom with me and some will attend via the online Zoom meeting. Students cannot swap around and do learning some weeks face-to-face and other weeks remotely. 

<br>

### FFR
To support your projects (assignments) as much as possible, I will need to understand the levels of technical skills you enter the module with. (So I sent you an email with a few questions in week 1.) FFR is for frequency following response, sometimes referred to as synchronisation. I plan to first synchronise to your current position (understand it) e.g. how much experience you have with audio-video software and then provide suitable support. As you will see, I like to get to know people by asking them to express their aims and methods and even takes notes to make sure I can remember everyone's progress.

<br>

## module aims and methods
- to help critically assess the current use of your digital identities (with the V&R map)
- to help further develop these digital identities by introducing tools/methods including
  - project management
  - logging
  - writing
  - audio-visual production
  - web-design and web-hosting

<br>

## log
- 2021-10-05 tested Zoom with student computer and ZoomDave in lab G and created a list of things todo before the lessons starts, could be 10 minutes, so perhaps set a task for students? Also tested audio cable splitters that could be used with the student computers to records audio via a microphone and so far the Zoom H1 via mini jack is the best solution. Perhaps need to test with the small clip mic as well to have something close by. 
- 2021-09-30 added drafts to give examples for 'work in progress' i.e. 'practice what you preach'. Made a plain V&R image in InkScape and uploaded .svg format to assets folder as well. Small edits in texts.
- 2021-09-29 updated digital-identity.md with V&R part 1,2,3. Refined readme.md; minor edits to GitHub heading in tools.md.
- 2021-09-28 moved assessment info to assessment template repo. Enabled GitHub pages which considers the readme.md file as if it was an index.md file (great).
- 2021-09-21 added digital-identities.md and syllabus.md. Decided that each file should be written for a wider audience (e.g. Medium) to help raise the quality of writing.
- 2021-09-07 - 2021-09-21 textual and structural refinements
- 2021-09-07 repository created with basic info
