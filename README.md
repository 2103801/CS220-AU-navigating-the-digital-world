## week 2 theory/assignment 
- carry on with planning w2 (theory): gen, v&r (part 1, 2, 3) + explain assignment 
- create assignment repo example
  - have a look at examples
  - create a public repo (that they could clone or download/upoad)
  - populate with all files needed (perhaps own v&r maps)
  - write assessment guide and rubric/checksheet
  - extract data from https://moodle.essex.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=376391

## syllabus w3 - w7
- outline in github repo
- tools.md
- other .md files
- publish on Medium?
### screencasts
- find mic solution
- book lab M or G
- make screencasts in lab G

## labs
- option A: student computer or lecturn
- option B: mac with remote desktop
- any update about the little table?
- revised hybrid class teaching (how can audio sources be mixed efficiently)
- are breakout rooms in hybrid classes possible?

## compulsory induction
- what compusory induction do I have to do?

## address all themes in syllabus
- digital identities
- e-safety
- blogging
- social media
- multimedia production
- intelligent search strategies

## address these questions:
- how are digital technologies transforming society?
- to what extent do digital technologies curb or enhance our rights and freedom?
- what digital skills are needed for the knowledge economy and a democratic society?
- how can we build and use our online identities?
- how might we use digital technologies as creative and engaging forms of communication?

This repository only contains information for the CS220 AU module, the Autumn term module. Information for Dr Di Franco's more theoretical module (CS220 SP) is on Moodle. If your enrollment code is CS220 AU (Autumn) or CS220 FY (Full Year) then the information below is relevant for you.

## Module description
The complete module description can be found on Moodle (or see in `assets/doc`folder).

## Further clarification
The module aims to **help manage our digital identities**

1. by introducing David White's [visitors & residents (v&r) modes](digital-identities.md/#visitors-and-residents) to help understand and develop our engagements on the Web and 
2. by introducing tools for project management, web-design and hosting as well as audio-visual production and post-production all which could help develop personal and professional/institutional resident identities on the Web i.e. digital identities or resident modes of engaging on the Web.

<!-- maybe quick introduction to 
visitor and 
resident modes
-->

While this module primarily focuses on providing practical skills it also opens up dialogues to help develop critical thinking about our digital identities and interactions e.g. by asking the following questions:

- how are we currently engaging with the Web and how can we improve this?
- how can we build and use our online identities e.g. a website for 'better' engagement?
- how can we use software tools to create assets e.g. audio-video content to help disseminate information via our online identities more effectively?
- how can we apply critical thinking regarding the information we consume and produce?
- why should we produce information and whom should we address with this information i.e. who is our target audience?
- what is the change we would like to see in the world and how can we use our resident identities on the Web to support this change?

The module introduces primarily free and cross-platform software and where possible highlights their advantages and disadvantages to paid software. As the module in 2021 is run in labs equipped with Windows PCs, I will demonstrate software in the workshops and screencasts using Windows 10 operating system (OS). (However, as the OS I primarily use is macOS, if desired, I can demonstrate on macOS as well.)

After this more practical Autumn term module, lecturers from different disciplines across the university will lead a series of weekly lectures during the Spring term (CS220 SP), which will combine theoretical questions with real-life scenarios to explore issues such as hacking, social media, ethics, digital crime, video games and interactive technologies. These sessions are devised to help students gain a broad awareness of, and to think critically about, the ways that digital technologies are reshaping contemporary societies. For more information about these lectures please contact Dr Di Franco.

### How much theory will we cover in this Authm module?
**In week 2**
- a brief overview of generations
- introduction to the visitor and resident map (white)

**In later weeks**
- information processing (sense making), critical thinking and dissemination
- intelligent search strategies using Google vs Duck Duck Go, Google Scholar and the library website
- e-safety e.g. efficient passwords

The rest of the information the module provides is practical i.e. we will experiment with software that can help us create and maintain 'better' digital identities. Everyone can have multiple identities on the Web however, (probably) only one professional identity. Our personal identities are more informal, subjective and our professional ones more formal and perhaps more objective as well.

## Assignment
The assignment is to submit a digital portfolio using GitHub. The portfolio needs to contain: 
- a weekly updated logbook on your assignment progress
- a link to your personal or professional website (can be about you or about one of your projects)
- a short report reflecting on your past, present and future digital identity (or identities) using the v&r map

More detailed information can be found in the [template](https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/CS220-AU-portfolio), which will be explained in detail.  

### Assigment examples
A few submissions from last year (Essex and ARU) to plant some ideas. 
<!-- TODO: create an example repo -->

## Students
Students enrolled in this module come from different disciplines/departments e.g. journalism, psychology, philosophy, art history, political science, media studies, literature. Most who enrol are 1st year, but there are some 2nd and 3rd years as well. Some students only do the practical part of the module (taught by me), some only the theoretical part (taught be Dr Di Franco), some do both. Due to Covid, the workshops will use a hybrid/dual-mode teaching method i.e. some students will be in the classroom with me and some will attend via the online Zoom meeting. Students cannot swap around and do learning some weeks face-to-face and other weeks remotely. (Make sure you know how much your mark for this module contributes to your final mark linked to your graduation certificate. 

### FFR
To be able to support your projects (assignments) as much as possible, I will need to understand the levels of technical skills you enter the module with. FFR is for frequency following response, sometimes referred to as synchronisation. In other words, to be able to provide efficient help, I need to first synchronise to your current position (understand it) e.g. how much experience you have with audio-video software and then provide suitable support. As you will see, I like to get to know people by asking them to express their aims and methods and even takes notes to make sure I can remember everyone's progress. 

## Module aims and methods
- to help critically assess your current use of your digital identities (with the v&r map)
- to help further develop your digital identities by introducing tools/methods for efficient project management including 
  - logging
  - writing
  - audio-visual production
  - web-design and web-hosting

## log
- 2021-09-28 moved assessment info to assessment template repo  
- 2021-09-21 added digital-identities.md and syllabus.md. Decided that each file should be written for a wider audience (e.g. Medium) to help raise the quality of writing.
