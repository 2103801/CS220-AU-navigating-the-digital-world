# CS220
CS220 Navigating the Digital World

## Module Outline
### Goal
- to introduce tools/methods for efficient project management including logging, writing, audio-visual production, web-desing and web-hosting
- primarily practical with some theory

### Outcome


## Tools 
### GitHub 
1. Sign up to GitHub
 - you will need an email address
2. Find my CS220 repository (https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/CS220) and watch it (all activity)
3. Create a private repository (repo)
  - will be used for your private notes
  - when creating it add the `readme.md` file
4. Create a public repo 
  - will be used for your public logbook (log) and public static website (GitHub Pages) 
  - when creating it add the `readme.md` file

### Visual Studio Code (VSC)
1. Install/launch the Visual Studio Code software on your computer
2. Make sure all of the following extensions are installed (some might need you to restart VSC or sometimes enabling when using a new folder/workstation e.g. when a GitHub repo is synced) :
  - Foam for VSCode (Wikilinks to Markdown)
  - Github Repositories
  - Markdown All in One
  - Markdown Links
  - Markdown Notes
  - Markdown PDF
  - Spell Right
3. Sync your GitHub account to VSC
4. Make some changes to your `readme.md` file in VSC and commit to GitHub
 - check your changes in your GitHub account (with an internet browser)

### Thoughts
You can edit your files in both, you GitHub account via a browser or in VSC on your computer. The main advantages of using VSC are that
 - you can use VSC's extensions e.g. *Spell Right* (although in your own browser you could install browser extensions/plugins for this as well) or *Foam* that helps you organse your thoughts in a more creative, systematic way and 
 - VSC's editor itself provides further clarity.

### Foam 
https://foambubble.github.io/foam/
known issue: it does not work well when using the `Github Repositories` extension, because the one the essential extensions used for Foam `Markdown All in One` does not work with virtual workspaces. So, the current idea is to use Foam with GitHub Desktop. 

## Sensemaking
### Methods
#### Rule Omega
- how to have a dialogue towards coherence
- (explicit language!) https://youtu.be/a-es9_IMXLY?t=1977 (~7 minutes between 32:58 - 42:20 - after jazz)
- question of vulnarability/trust/mental wellbeing/safe place/open-source vs copyright
