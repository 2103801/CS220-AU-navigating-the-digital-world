# CS220 Navigating the Digital World
University of Essex    
Department: Interdisciplinary Studies   
School of Philosophy and Arts History  
Wed 11-1pm Lab M

## Students
Studens enrolled in this module come from different disciplines/departments e.g journalism, psychology, philosophy, art history, political science, media studies, literature. Most who enroll are 1st year, some 2nd and 3rd years as well. Some stuents only do the practical part of the module (taught by me), some only the theoritical part (taught be Paula). Due to Covid, the classes will use a hybrid/dual mode teaching method i.e. some students will be in the classroom with me and some will attend via the online Zoom meeting.  

## Module description
What does it mean to be a "digital citizen"? As increasing portions of our personal and professional lives are played out online, acquiring the ability to effectively use digital interfaces and think critically about them is an ever more urgent task, as well as a topic of fierce debate. While some allege that we live in a "post-fact" era filled with "fake news" that limits our worldview, others see in digital technologies the key to unlocking social change and bringing people together in new ways and across geographical boundaries.

- sum up: digital visitors and residents

The digital revolution is constantly reshaping our world in a myriad of ways: from surveillance laws to social mobilisation; from innovative business models to open access information; from warfare strategy to medical treatment. Not only this, the way we construct our individual identities, build communities, protect human rights, and promote the humanities is increasingly mediated through online platforms, and contingent on the uneven access that global communities have to technology.

In order to be active parts of our fast-evolving world, it is useful to have control over our own digital identity. The module will help you manage your digital identity by introducing software tools for project management, web-design and development as well as audio-visual production. While the module is primarily focused on providing practical skills it will also open up dialogues to help develop critical thinking about our digital interactions.

<!-- add sense making -->

Some of the key questions we'll be addressing

- how can we build and use our online identities?
- how can we use digital technologies as creative and engaging forms of communication?
<!-- 
- how are digital technologies transforming society?
- to what extent do digital technologies curb or enhance our rights and freedom?
- what digital skills are needed for the knowledge economy and a democratic society?
-->

After this primarily practical Authum term module, lecturers from different disciplines across the University will lead a series of weekly lectures during the Spring term, which will combine theoretical questions with real-life scenarios to explore issues such as hacking, social media, ethics, digital crime, video games and interactive technologies. These sessions are devised to help students gain a broad awareness of, and to think critically about, the ways that digital technologies are reshaping contemporary societies.

## module aims/goals
- to introduce tools/methods for efficient project management including logging, writing, audio-visual production, web-desing and web-hosting
- help acquire technical skills required to create and maintain a personal website
- primarily practical with some theory to induce discussions on the effective use of digital technologies
