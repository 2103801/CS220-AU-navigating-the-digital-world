## syllabus w3 - w7
- outline in github repo
- tools.md
- other .md files
- publish on Medium?
### screencasts
- find mic solution
- book lab M or G
- make screencasts in lab G

## labs
- option A: student computer or lecturn
- option B: mac with remote desktop
- any update about the little table?
- revised hybrid class teaching (how can audio sources be mixed efficiently)
- are breakout rooms in hybrid classes possible?

## compulsory induction
- what compusory induction do I have to do?

## address all themes in syllabus
- digital identities
- e-safety
- blogging
- social media
- multimedia production
- intelligent search strategies

## address these questions:
- how are digital technologies transforming society?
- to what extent do digital technologies curb or enhance our rights and freedom?
- what digital skills are needed for the knowledge economy and a democratic society?
- how can we build and use our online identities?

# CS220 AU Navigating the Digital World
University of Essex    
Department: Interdisciplinary Studies   
School of Philosophy and Arts History  
Wed 11-1pm Lab M  
Thu 11-1pm Lab G  

This repository only contains information for the CS220 AU module, the Autumn term module. Information for Dr Di Franco's more theoretical module (CS220 SP) is on Moodle. If your enrollment code is CS220 FY (Full Year) then the information below is relevant for you as well as FY means that you enrolled in both, AU and SP. 

## Module description
The complete module description can be found on Moodle (or see in `assets/doc`folder).

## Further clarification
<!-- To actively take part in our fast-evolving world, we need to have control over our own digital identities.--> 

The module aims to **help manage our digital identities**

1. by introducing David White's [visitors & residents (v&r) modes](digital-identities.md/#visitors-and-residents) to help understand and develop our engagments with the Web and 
2. by introducing tools for project management, web-design as well as audio-visual production and post production to help develop personal and professional resident identities  on the Web i.e. what White often referred to as 'resident modes engagement'. 

While this module primarily focuses on providing practical skills it also opens up dialogues to help develop critical thinking about our digital identities and interactions e.g. by asking the following questions:

- how are we currently engaging with the Web and how can we improve this?
- how can we build and use our online identities e.g. a website for 'better' engagement?
- how can we use software tools to create assets e.g. audio-video content to help disseminate information via our online identities more effectively?
- how can we apply critical thinking regarding the information we consume and produce?
- why should we produce information and whom should we address with this information i.e. who is our target audience?

The module introduces primarily free and cross-platform software and where possible highlights their advantages and disadvantages to paid software. As the module in 2021 is run in labs equipt with Windows PCs, I will demonstrate these software in the workshops and screencasts using Windows 10 operating system (OS). (However, as the OS I primarily use is macOS, if desired, I can demonstrate on macOS as well.)

After this primarily practical Authmn term module, lecturers from different disciplines across the university will lead a series of weekly lectures during the Spring term, which will combine theoretical questions with real-life scenarios to explore issues such as hacking, social media, ethics, digital crime, video games and interactive technologies. These sessions are devised to help students gain a broad awareness of, and to think critically about, the ways that digital technologies are reshaping contemporary societies. For more information about these lectures please contact Dr Di Franco.

### How much theory will we cover in this Authm module?
**In week 2:**
- a brief overview of generations
- introduction to the visitor and resident map (white)

**In later weeks:**
- information processing (sense making), critical thinking and dissemination
- intelligent search strategies using Google vs Duck Duck Go, Google Scholar and the library website
- e-safety e.g. efficient passwords

The rest of the information the module provides is practical i.e. we will experiment with software that can help us create and maintain 'better' digital identites. Everyone can have multiple identities on the Web however, (probably) only one professional identity. Our personal identities are more informal, subjective and our professional ones more formal and perhaps more objective as well. 

## Assignment
The assigment is to submit a portfolio consisting of two main parts:
- the online presence of a project e.g. a personal or professional website
- a short report reflecting on your past, present and future digital identity (or identies) using the v&r map
  - reflect on how you use digital technology in different contexts
  - explore your own "digital journey" by thinking about the different digital devices you have bought (or been given) over your lifetime

### Assignment template
<!-- TODO: create an example repo -->
The example will be explained in class. 

## Module assignment <!-- maybe to go in the template repo-->
One GitHub repository containing the following files:
- README.md file:
  - short overview/abstract
  - link to project website
  - lookbook
- report.md (500 - 750 word) 
- report.pdf (optional, report.md exported into PDF format)
Report needs to contain: project goals, design, testing, development, deployment (include feedback from others)
- assets/v&r-map-2021-10.jpg (embdedded in report.md)
- assets/v&r-map-2021-11.jpg (embdedded in report.md)
- assets/v&r-map-2021-12.jpg (embdedded in report.md)

### Assigment examples
In class we will look at a few submission from last year (Essex and ARU) to plant some ideas. 
<!-- TODO: create an example repo -->

## Students
Studens enrolled in this module come from different disciplines/departments e.g. journalism, psychology, philosophy, art history, political science, media studies, literature. Most who enroll are 1st year, but there are some 2nd and 3rd years as well. Some students only do the practical part of the module (taught by me), some only the theoritical part (taught be Paula), some do both. Due to Covid, the classes will use a hybrid/dual mode teaching method i.e. some students will be in the classroom with me and some will attend via the online Zoom meeting. Students cannot swap around and do learning some weeks face-to-face and other weeks remotely. (Make sure you know how much your mark for this module contributes to your final mark linke to your graduation certificate. 

### FFR
To be able to support your projects (assignments) as much as possible, I will need to understand the levels of technical and aesthetic (and perhaps theoritical) skills you enter the module with. FFR is for frequency following response, sometimes referred to as sycnronisation. In other words, to be able to provide efficient help, I need to first syncronise to your current position (understand it) e.g. how much experience you have with audio-video software and then provide suitable support. As you will see, I like to get to know people by asking them to express their aims and methods and even takes notes to make sure I can remember everyone's progress. 

## Module aims and methods
- to help critically assess your current use of your digital identies (with the v&r map)
- to help further develop your digital identies by introducing tools/methods for efficient project management including 
  - logging
  - writing
  - audio-visual production
  - web-desing and web-hosting
