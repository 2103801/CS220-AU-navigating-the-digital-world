# CS220 AU Navigating the Digital World
University of Essex    
Department: Interdisciplinary Studies   
School of Philosophy and Arts History  
Wed 11-1pm Lab M  
Thu 11-1pm Lab G  

This repository only contains information for the CS220 AU module, the Autumn term module. Information for Dr Di Franco's more theoretical module (CS220 SP) is on Moodle.

## Module description
The complete module description can be found on Moodle (or see in `assets/doc`folder).

## Further clarification
<!-- To actively take part in our fast-evolving world, we need to have control over our own digital identities.--> 

The module aims to **help manage our digital identities**

1. by introducing the 'visitor & resident map' which can help understand and develop our involvement with the Web and 
2. by introducing tools for project management, web-design as well as audio-visual production and post production to help develop personal and professional resident identities. 

While this module primarily focuses on providing practical skills it also opens up dialogues to help develop critical thinking about our digital identities and interactions.

The module introduces primarily free and cross-platform software and where possible highlights their advantages and disadvantages to paid software. As the module in 2021 is run in labs equipt with Windows PCs, I will demonstrate these software in the workshops and screencasts using Windows 10 operating system. 

After this primarily practical Authmn term module, lecturers from different disciplines across the university will lead a series of weekly lectures during the Spring term, which will combine theoretical questions with real-life scenarios to explore issues such as hacking, social media, ethics, digital crime, video games and interactive technologies. These sessions are devised to help students gain a broad awareness of, and to think critically about, the ways that digital technologies are reshaping contemporary societies.

### So how much theory will we cover in this Authm module?
**In week 2:**
- a brief overview of generations
- introduction to the visitor and resident map (white)

In later weeks:
- information processing (sense making), critical thinking and dissemination
- intelligent search strategies using Google vs Duck Duck Go, Google Scholar and the library website
- e-safety e.g. efficient passwords

The rest of the information the module provides is practical i.e. we will experiment with software that can help us create and maintain 'better' digital identites. Everyone can have multiple identities on the Web however, (probably) only one professional identity. Our personal identities are more informal, subjective and our professional ones more formal and perhaps more objective as well. 

## Assignment
The assigment is to submit a portfolio consisting of two main parts:
- the online presence of a project e.g. a personal or professional website
- a short report reflecting on your past, present and future digital identity (or identies) using the 'visitor and resident' map

### Assignment template
<!-- TODO: create an example repo -->
The example will be explained in class. 

### Assigment examples
In class we will look at a few submission from last year to plant some ideas. 
<!-- TODO: create an example repo -->


## Students
Studens enrolled in this module come from different disciplines/departments e.g. journalism, psychology, philosophy, art history, political science, media studies, literature. Most who enroll are 1st year, but there are some 2nd and 3rd years as well. Some students only do the practical part of the module (taught by me), some only the theoritical part (taught be Paula), some do both. Due to Covid, the classes will use a hybrid/dual mode teaching method i.e. some students will be in the classroom with me and some will attend via the online Zoom meeting. Students cannot swap around and do learning some weeks face-to-face and other weeks remotely. (Make sure you know how much your mark for this module contributes to your final mark linke to your graduation certificate. 


## module aims/goals
- to introduce tools/methods for efficient project management including logging, writing, audio-visual production, web-desing and web-hosting
- help acquire technical skills required to create and maintain a personal website
- primarily practical with some theory to induce discussions on the effective use of digital technologies 

## module assignment
One GitHub repository containing the following files:
- README.md file:
  - short overview/abstract
  - link to project website
  - lookbook
- report.md (500 - 750 word) 
- report.pdf (optional, report.md exported into PDF format)
Report needs to contain: project goals, design, testing, development, deployment (include feedback from others)
- assets/v&r-map-2021-10.jpg (embdedded in report.md)
- assets/v&r-map-2021-11.jpg (embdedded in report.md)
- assets/v&r-map-2021-12.jpg (embdedded in report.md)

## assignment criteria
<!--TODO: 
- provide a repository example that perhaps students could download/upload or clone?
- check current module assessment criteria and adjust to own module syllabus
- write checklist
- examples: last year's CS220 and sonic art
-->


<!-- 
Some of the key questions (from the module description) that we'll be addressing

- how are we currently engaging with the Web and can we improve this?
- how can we build and use our online identities e.g. a website for 'better' engagement?
- how can we use software tools to create assets e.g. audio-video content to help us disseminate information through our online identities?
- how can we apply critical thinking regarding the information we consume and produce? 

- how are digital technologies transforming society?
- to what extent do digital technologies curb or enhance our rights and freedom?
- what digital skills are needed for the knowledge economy and a democratic society?
-->


## module outcomes
By the end of this module, students should have

- a deeper understanding of digital literacies, as well as the confidence and ability to use a broad range of digital technologies
- the ability to discuss the material covered on the module and to demonstrate this competence through coursework, seminar discussions and the creation of a website
- a good understanding of topics and debates that are central to the digital world 
- confidence in using a number of specialised terms and terminology on digital technologies
- a deeper understanding of the impacts of digital technologies on society and human life

## syllabus
This syllabus was desinged to provide you with a basis for your online identity (or one of your projects' online identity) which is a personal or a project website. (For the assignment you can work on a personal or a project website.)

- what do you think are your strengths and weaknesses (what needs improving?)
- which part of the syllabus will be easy/difficult for you?
- do you already have a website?
- do you have a previous or ongoing project that you would like to show your class?

##### Visitors and Residents (Dave White)
"Visitors and Residents is a simple way of describing the range of ways individuals can engage with the Web." (http://daveowhite.com/vandr/) White's V&R map helps all ages (not just old people) and people with low technical skills to use the Web efficiently. His V&R map is based on people's motivation to engage with the Web and has two modes: visitor and resident modes
- visitor modes: the activities where we don't leave a social trace behind e.g. searching the web, paying our bills. (Remember that your search history could be stored depending on the search engine you use, this search history is just not available for everyone.) 
- resident modes: activities where we are present with other people and our we leave a social trance (stays online after we leave the internet) e.g. by creating content or commenting on other people's content on online platforms (websites, social media). These activities are linked to our (digital) identities, therefore we should be mindful when we use the Web in this mode. 

- k's v&r-map-2006.jpg (2006) --> k's v&r-map-2016.jpg --> k's v&r-map-2021.jpg <!--TODO-->

- this CS220 (AU) course introduces ideas and practical skills to help develop our residence modes
- Why? Because a better understanding of our residence modes can lead to 
  - better professional identies, better understanding of how we shoul produce and consume knowledge e.g. regarding the credibility of information

- check slides on http://daveowhite.com/vandr/vr-mapping/ for map examples

questions to ask ourselves
- can our current map be improved?
