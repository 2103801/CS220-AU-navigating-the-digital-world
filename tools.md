# Tools 
## GitHub 
1. Sign up to GitHub
 - you will need an email address
 - your username needs to be your student number
 - use a good password
2. Create a private repository
  - will be used for your private notes
  - name it as `notes`
  - when creating it add the `readme.md` file
3. Fork my `CS220-AU-portfolio` repository
  - will be used for your digital portfolio (to submit)
  - you can turn some files in this repository into your website (or submit a website made with another CMS e.g. Wordpress)

### Markdown
Familiarise yourself with Markdown language here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ (there is a shortcut for this link in the file editor in your repository). <!-- add a screenshot? -->

### thoughts
- choose 'soft wrap' instead of 'no wrap' in the editor
- there are slightly different Markdown versions, but in general they all work the same (stick to the above if using with GitHub)
- we can monitor each others' progress on the public repository. Please update it at least once a week. <!-- TODO: make example repo for private and public. Perhaps show examples of sonic art students from ARU. -->
- is GitHub safe to use e.g regarding tracking and cookies? [https://youtu.be/vAfBW1_AZkU?t=597](https://youtu.be/vAfBW1_AZkU?t=597)
- we can give feedback on each work in GitHub in different ways e.g. by raising an 'Issue' or collaborating and suggesting changes <!-- #todo make screencast -->
- GitHub vs Dropbox, etc. advantages/disadvantages 

<!-- #todo
- how to embed/create graphs in the markdown files in the repository e.g. in the `readme.md` file?
-->
