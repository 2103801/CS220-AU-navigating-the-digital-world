# Lecturer Opening Statement

At the start of all teaching events I must remind you that they should be aware of their responsibilities 
during a teaching event:

- If you should be isolating or are experiencing covid-19 symptoms you should not come to teaching events and 
must leave now (if this happens then this should be reported to covid-19@essex.ac.uk).
- If you have not already done so, you should now wipe down any areas you will touch with a wipe.
- Please avoid leaving during the event, where you have to leave please minimise the number of people you 
pass and allow others time to move out of the way.
- If you need to cough or sneeze do so into a tissue or the crook of your elbow.
- Do not move between seats during event.
- Do not share items such as textbooks or calculators.
- At the end of the event please leave promptly in order from students nearest to the exit. If you have follow 
up questions after the event ends please sent these via email/zoom. Do not come to the front to ask 
questions.
- When you leave take all your belongings with you and dispose of rubbish (e.g. wipes) in the bin
Where teaching is non-standard any additional procedures should be explained to students at the start of the event. 
Students should be made aware of where they can access the risk assessments for their teaching.
